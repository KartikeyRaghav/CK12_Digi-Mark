                    <p>Known to have a delicate flavor, white tea comes from the Camellia sinensis plant that’s native
                        to China and India. It is also the least processed tea variety.</p>
                    <p>Research shows it may be the most effective tea in fighting various forms of cancer thanks to its
                        high level of antioxidants. White tea may also be good for your teeth since it contains a high
                        source of fluoride, catechins and tannins that can strengthen teeth, fight plaque, and make it
                        more resistant to acid and sugar.</p>
                    <p>This variety also offers the least amount of caffeine, making it a smart choice for tea drinkers
                        who want to avoid or limit their caffeine consumption.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Herbal teas, sometimes called tisanes, are very similar to white teas, but they contain a blend
                        of herbs, spices, fruits or other plants in addition to tea leaves. Herbal teas don’t contain
                        caffeine, which is why they’re known for their calming properties.</p>
                    <p>There are numerous types of herbal teas, all with their unique benefits. Some of the most popular
                        herbal teas include:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="ul">
                        <li><span>Chamomile Tea:</span> Helps to reduce menstrual pain and muscle spasms, improves sleep
                            and relaxation, and reduces stress.</li>
                        <li><span>Rooibos:</span> Improves blood pressure and circulation, boosts good cholesterol while

                            allergies.</li>
                        <li><span>Peppermint:</span> Contains menthol, which can soothe an upset stomach and serve as a
                            cure for constipation, irritable bowel syndrome and motion sickness. This tea variety also
                            offers pain relief from tension headaches and migraines.</li>
                        <li><span>Ginger:</span> Helps to fight against morning sickness, can be used to treat chronic
                            indigestion and helps to relieve joint pain caused by osteoarthritis.</li>

                    <p>Green tea originates from China, where the leaves are processed with heat using a pan-firing or
                        roasting method and Japan, where the leaves are more commonly steamed.</p>
                    <p>Green tea is exceptionally high in flavonoids that can help boost your heart health by lowering
                        bad cholesterol and reducing blood clotting. Studies show this type of tea can also help lower
                        blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol.</p>
                    <p>Other research has found that green tea has a possible impact on liver, breast, prostate and
                        colorectal cancers. This tea variety has also shown to be anti-inflammatory, which helps keep
                        your skin clear and glowing.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Black tea is made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, the same plant that’s used to
                        make green tea. However, the leaves are dried and fermented, giving black tea a darker color and
                        richer flavor.</p>
                    <p>Unlike many other varieties, black tea is caffeinated, so it’s important to monitor your intake.
                        When you do pour yourself a cup of black tea, you benefit from flavonoids that combat
                        inflammation and support healthy immune function.</p>
                    <p>However, you don’t have to merely drink black tea to benefit from its healthy properties. It can
                        be steamed, cooled and then pressed on minor cuts, scrapes and bruises to relieve pain and
                        reduce swelling. A black tea bath can also ease inflammation caused by skin rashes and
                        conditions such as poison ivy.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese tea variety that’s made from the same plant used to make
                        green and black teas. The difference is how the tea is processed: Green tea is not allowed to
                        oxidize much, but black tea is allowed to oxidize until it turns black. Oolong tea is somewhere
                        in between the two, so it is partially oxidized. This partial oxidation is responsible for
                        oolong tea's color and characteristic taste.</p>
                    <p>Oolong tea is notable for containing l-theanine, an amino acid that reduces anxiety and increases
                        alertness and attention. Scientists have found that l-theanine can help prevent cognitive
                        diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.</p>
                    <p>Oolong tea is also high in polyphenols, which are linked to lowering inflammation, preventing the
                        growth of cancers and decreasing type 2 diabetes risk.</p>

                        <li>Detox teas made for fad diets that suggest you will quickly lose weight. These teas often

                        <li>Fancy tea lattes and drinks from your favorite chain store. While some of these drinks, such
                            as a green tea latte, may appear healthy, they are loaded with sugar.</li>
                        <li>Trendy bubble teas that are also loaded with sugar, calories and carbs, and have little to
                            no nutritional value.</li>
                        <li>Herbal teas that may potentially trigger allergies. Many herbal teas contain different types
                            of fruits, herbs, spices and flowers that some people are allergic to. If you have
                            allergies, always read the ingredients on the package before you consume a new herbal tea.
