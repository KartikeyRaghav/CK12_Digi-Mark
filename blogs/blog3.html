                    <p>Tea bags are typically small, porous pouches that contain dried leaves, flowers, or herbs that
                        are infused in hot or boiling water to brew tea. Tea bags are available for a wide variety of
                        teas including true teas and herbal teas.</p>
                    <p>True teas are all teas made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant including white tea,
                        green tea, yellow tea, oolong tea, pu-erh tea, and black tea. Herbal teas are made from all
                        other plants and include popular favorites such as ginger tea, apple tea, and chamomile tea.</p>
                    <p>Other popular tea blends such as Earl Grey, raspberry green tea, and masala chai tea are also
                        available in tea bag form</p>
                    <p>Tea bags are typically made of filter paper or food-grade plastics. They are occasionally made of
                        silk, although silk is considered to inhibit full flavor development. In Asia, the term tea bag
                        often refers to the paper wrapping or envelopes that contain loose tea leaves. The tea leaves
                        are removed from the packaging and steeped as loose leaf teas.</p>
                    <p>Tea bags essentially work as a simplified tea infuser. They often include a string that enables
                        easy removal and a small tag with brewing instructions. Most are made of paper fiber and other
                        biodegradable materials.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Tea bags have been used for centuries in the tea industry. The bags were initially developed in
                        the 8th century under the rule of the Tang Dynasty. The first tea bags were made of paper that
                        was folded and stitched by hand into square bags. The paper was used to preserve the flavor and
                        aroma of the tea.</p>
                    <p>In the western hemisphere, tea bags were first used in the early 1900's. Two women—Roberta C.
                        Lawson and Mary Molaren—filed the first patent for a 'tea leaf holder'. They used stitched mesh
                        fabric to enable the tea leaves to expand and infuse flavor while also making tea brewing more
                        convenient.</p>
                    <p>Another of the first manufacturers of these tea bags was known as Thomas Sullivan (1). He
                        initially used silk before switching to gauze, which he discovered infused tea leaves more
                        efficiently.</p>
                    <p>The first company to manufacture tea bags using machinery was the tea company Teekanne in Germany
                        in 1929. By 1930, William Hermanson patented the heat-sealed paper tea bag. It wasn't until 1944
                        that the rectangular tea bag was invented. Up to this point, all tea bags were small and
                        shapeless sacks. In 1953, the British tea company Tetley began to mass-produce tea bags.</p>
                    <p>In modern times, tea bags are available in the small, rectangular shape and in larger sachets and
                        sacks. Circular tea bags are also available with no strings to help limit waste. Teas are also
                        commonly sold in tea tins and large bags similar to coffee bags.</p>
