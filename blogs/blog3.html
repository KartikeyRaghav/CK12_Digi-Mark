                    <p>Tea bags are typically small, porous pouches that contain dried leaves, flowers, or herbs that
                        are infused in hot or boiling water to brew tea. Tea bags are available for a wide variety of
                        teas including true teas and herbal teas.</p>
                    <p>True teas are all teas made from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant including white tea,
                        green tea, yellow tea, oolong tea, pu-erh tea, and black tea. Herbal teas are made from all
                        other plants and include popular favorites such as ginger tea, apple tea, and chamomile tea.</p>
                    <p>Other popular tea blends such as Earl Grey, raspberry green tea, and masala chai tea are also
                        available in tea bag form</p>
                    <p>Tea bags are typically made of filter paper or food-grade plastics. They are occasionally made of
                        silk, although silk is considered to inhibit full flavor development. In Asia, the term tea bag
                        often refers to the paper wrapping or envelopes that contain loose tea leaves. The tea leaves
                        are removed from the packaging and steeped as loose leaf teas.</p>
                    <p>Tea bags essentially work as a simplified tea infuser. They often include a string that enables
                        easy removal and a small tag with brewing instructions. Most are made of paper fiber and other
                        biodegradable materials.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Tea bags have been used for centuries in the tea industry. The bags were initially developed in
                        the 8th century under the rule of the Tang Dynasty. The first tea bags were made of paper that
                        was folded and stitched by hand into square bags. The paper was used to preserve the flavor and
                        aroma of the tea.</p>
                    <p>In the western hemisphere, tea bags were first used in the early 1900's. Two women—Roberta C.
                        Lawson and Mary Molaren—filed the first patent for a 'tea leaf holder'. They used stitched mesh
                        fabric to enable the tea leaves to expand and infuse flavor while also making tea brewing more
                        convenient.</p>
                    <p>Another of the first manufacturers of these tea bags was known as Thomas Sullivan (1). He
                        initially used silk before switching to gauze, which he discovered infused tea leaves more
                        efficiently.</p>
                    <p>The first company to manufacture tea bags using machinery was the tea company Teekanne in Germany
                        in 1929. By 1930, William Hermanson patented the heat-sealed paper tea bag. It wasn't until 1944
                        that the rectangular tea bag was invented. Up to this point, all tea bags were small and
                        shapeless sacks. In 1953, the British tea company Tetley began to mass-produce tea bags.</p>
                    <p>In modern times, tea bags are available in the small, rectangular shape and in larger sachets and
                        sacks. Circular tea bags are also available with no strings to help limit waste. Teas are also
                        commonly sold in tea tins and large bags similar to coffee bags.</p>

                        <h3>Convenience</h3>
                        <p>The main benefit of tea bags is that they are convenient. It's easy to pop a tea bag into a
                            hot cup of water or to-go mug and get on with the rest of your day. There's no fiddling
                            around with tea tools or having to wash extra dishes afterward. The handy attached string
                            makes clean up easy as you can just toss the tea bag into the garbage or compost pile.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>No Mess</h3>
                        <p>Another benefit of tea bags is that there is no mess. You simply remove the bag and voila—a
                            perfect cup of tea without mucking up the kitchen. If you've used loose tea before, you know
                            that you need a tea infuser or tea strainer to remove the loose leaves. That means you'll
                            have extra equipment you need to clean. Tea bags take the hassle out of making tea by
                            streamlining the process.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Perfect for Iced Tea</h3>
                        <p>Tea bags are particularly well-suited for making iced tea. Brewing iced tea can be a big job,
                            especially if you're adding in fresh fruit or flavorings. Brewing with tea bags makes the
                            process simpler and faster so you can get on to other preparations for a big celebration or
                            backyard tea party.</p>

                        <h3>Don't Contain All Healthy Compounds</h3>
                        <p>Unlike whole leaf teas, tea bags generally contain broken leaves, dust, and fannings created
                            during the CTC or crush-tear-curl method of production. The leaves are placed into large
                            rolling machines that break down whole leaves into smaller pieces that fit into tea bags.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this process results in degradation of the healthy compounds such as such as
                            l-theanine and antioxidants inherent to the tea plant that help to detox and improve overall
                            health.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Don't Fully Infuse Flavor</h3>
                        <p>Another issue with tea bags is that many of them are too small and they subsequently
                            constrict the tea leaves. Tea leaves release flavor by expanding in water; when the leaves
                            are restricted, they are unable to infuse the flavor as well. This can result in a weaker
                            cup of tea lacking the rich flavor of brewed loose leaf blends.</p>
                    </div>

            <h1 class="heading">Getting the Most Out of Tea Bags</h1>

                    <img src="../images/tea-bags-2.jpeg" alt="Getting the most out of tea bags">
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Just because tea bags have some drawbacks doesn't mean you can't use them. Drinking tea is all
                        about enjoyment. If you're in a hurry and need to use a tea bag, go for it. Just make sure to
                        follow these guidelines to select the best tea bags that preserve flavor and aroma.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Large, Loose Sachets</h3>
                        <p>Since small tea bags result in inferior flavor, using large sachets instead helps to minimize
                            this drawback. Loose sachets ensure the leaves have plenty of space to expand and infuse
                            flavor. Pyramid shaped tea bags are particularly useful since the tea leaves are free to
                            float around both sideways and vertically.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Quality Construction</h3>
                        <p>Look for tea bags that are unbleached to prevent the alteration of flavors from chemicals.
                            Tea bags that are heat sealed are better than those with metal staples as the metal can
                            affect flavor. If you're looking to cut down on waste, opt for tea bags that don't contain
                            excess wrapping or strings and tags.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>High Quality Leaves</h3>
                        <p>Whether you choose black tea bags, green tea bags, or even powdered matcha green tea, the
                            quality of the leaves makes all the difference in brewing. This is true whether you plan on
                            making a cup of tea using loose leaves or tea bags. You can also purchase tea that is
                            certified fair trade to ensure healthy working and growing conditions are established.</p>
                        <p>Always purchase tea from a reputable company to ensure the best flavor. The tea company
                            should prominently list where the tea comes from and how it was grown. Teas grown in the
                            Philippines will taste different than those grown in China or Africa. That's due to
                            terroir—the idea that climate, earth composition, and other environmental factors affect
                            flavor and aroma.</p>

                            fillable tea bags! These filter-paper pouches allow you to enjoy your favorite high-quality

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Tea bags are convenient and minimize the mess typically associated with traditional brewing
                        methods. While we still recommend using loose leaf tea whenever possible, you can use tea bags
                        in a pinch.</p>
                    <p>Tea bags are great when you're in a hurry and simply don't have time for cleanup. Make sure to
                        select tea bags that are large enough to allow the leaves to fully expand and infuse flavor. Opt
                        for tea bags that contain whole leaves to get better flavor and health benefits.</p>
                    <p>When it comes down to it, the healthiest tea is the tea you drink. Don't skip a hot cuppa just
                        because you don't want to pull out the tea tools. Simply pop in a high-quality, large sachet tea
                        bag and sip to your health.</p>
